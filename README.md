## Local Development Quickstart

The only dependency you need to run locally is Node v20.x. `pnpm` is preferred as a package manager.

Run:

- `make install` to install dependencies
- `make` / `make format` to reformat and lint application code
- `make dev` to launch a local development server
- `make build` to build and output a production-ready version
- `make clean` to remove build directories and project dependencies
