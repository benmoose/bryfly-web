## Local Development Quickstart

The only dependency you need to run locally is Node v20.x. `pnpm` is preferred as a package manager.

Useful commands:

- `make` / `make format-all` reformats application code and applies linter fixes.
- `make install` installs the project's dependencies.
- `make dev` launches a local development server.
- `make start` starts Next.js in production mode.
- `make build` generates a production build of the project.
- `make clean` removes build artifacts and project dependencies.
