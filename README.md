## Local Development Quickstart

The only dependency you need to run locally is Node v20.x. `pnpm` is preferred as a package manager.

Useful commands:

- `make` / `make format-all` standardise code format and run linter.
- `make dev` launch a local development server.
- `make start` start Next.js in production mode.
- `make install` install project dependencies.
- `make build` generate a production build for the project.
- `make clean` remove generated build artifacts and dependencies.
- `make update-node` updates the project's Node version.
